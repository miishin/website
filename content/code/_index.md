[Everything can be found on my Github @miishin](https://github.com/miishin/)

But some things I've worked on:

***

[This Website](https://github.com/miishin/website)

Styling and structure is all done through a Hugo theme, so all I had to do was write content in markdown files.

Quick and simple. 

***

[A Game in Godot Engine](https://github.com/miishin/miipd)

A simple tactical RPG game (similiar to FFT) made with my friend in the Godot Engine. 

Godot makes game development incredibly easy and makes it much more akin to normal object oriented programming.

[Fish](https://github.com/miishin/CS4500)

Software development course project. I had to create a game from scratch in Python with a partner. 

Later in the course every partnership traded partners with another. I was moved to a new codebase and had to work with a new partner in an unfamiliar codebase. 

After a few weeks, my partner was replaced again and I had to onboard this partner and work together to finish the course. 

Lectures were replaced with code walks/reviews where partners would present their code to be critiqued by their peers.

[Text Notification Bot](https://github.com/miishin/minis)

Quick Python bot that takes subscriptions by text and then can send out texts to all numbers it has saved.

***

[School Org Database](https://github.com/miishin/nuvsa_mapdiem)

Python/Flask app connected to MySQL database to keep track of club members and their point totals.

***

[Robotics - Xilinux ZedBoard](https://github.com/miishin/eece2160)

School project using C++ and Simulink designs to control a robotic arm to perform given tasks.

*** 

[Basic AI Algorithms](https://github.com/miishin/Foundations-of-AI)

AI course where I implemented:

- Depth first search
- Breadth first search
- Uniform cost search
- A* search
- Basic heuristics
- Reflex agents
- Minimax
- Alpha-beta pruning
- Expectimax
- State evaluation functions
- Value iteration
- Q-learning

in the context of the game of Pac-man.

MVC Animator

Created an animator that would display animations based off a given input. Inputs were text files that defined shapes, movements, scaling, and color changes in order of application. No source code link to prevent plagiarism.
